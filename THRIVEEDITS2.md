 

It seems like some of the edits I've requested in the previous file were not addressed at all. I'll go through them once more. Please be thorough to check everyone and there are additional new ones. On the home page, which will be the splash screen with the four choices for each of the four pages, remove the text in the header. So it's just the logo and the light mode, dark mode icon, no text in the header. And then you can remove in the top section this is a future well-grounded text. You can remove that and make the home page, splash page, four choice page always in dark mode. So you can actually remove the light mode, dark mode just in this one page, but we want light mode and dark mode for all the other four pages. Hope that makes sense.

In design a dark mode, the header text is black on a black charcoal black screen. That's clearly not going to work. So to make the header one white or gradient white and it needs padding above it. So you remove too much padding. The buttons are not the buttons in the hero section are not these you got to fix them. They're not real buttons. They work with a rollover. The text is not centered in the buttons. You did a good job with the trusted developers. That's nice. All the other stuff is good in dark mode for number a light mode for design a same thing. Once you fix the buttons, they'll correct themselves in the light mode, add some padding above the quote, the new development imperative h1 header in the hero section is too close to the top menu. I'm not going to pick on anything else in the light mode except for the four circle icons above the four founding leadership team. The leadership team are just black circles with black gray circles with black outlines. Just make it black and white and get rid of the solid fill of the icon placeholders for the leadership team.

For design B in dark mode, the same thing, black text on the dark green gray background is not readable. So make the hero one text in the hero section or head in one text in the hero section white or gradient white. And again, if you can't make the animated line objects appear behind all text and boxes, then try a different animated effect. There is a header in the second section called quote the connectivity mandate close quote in the dark mode is black text that needs to be white. Actually, all the headers in each section are black text, then they have to be white in the dark mode for design B. So change that universally don't know what happened. Gradient gradient like when I say gradient white, I mean like pure white to 10% gray gradient across the header one and header two text in dark mode for design B. In the light mode. It looks okay. The same issue with the lines in the hero section or covering up stuff. Try just try different animation that use in both light and dark dark mode. I'm not going to pick on anything in the light mode of design B. It's okay.

Design C in dark mode. We still have a massive problem here because it is not dark. Make all the background of design C, design hyphen C, make all the web page background gradient black. No backgrounds that are white. I don't know how this has come up. So that's the point of dark mode, isn't it? And then where we have white objects on the black background, the contrast is way too stark. So make those gradient gray color objects on black background. When you make the background black, you've got to make sure the header one, header two text is white or off white or gradient white, gray, gray scale white. So I can't really edit design C dark mode because it's got so many problems. Please correct this. Design C white mode, light mode. There's a little text at the very top in the hero section right below the navigation menu that says the future well-grounded trademark. It appears in a white mode in dark mode of design C. Delete that so it's not there in either one. The button in the hero section says start your project or view success stories. The text needs to be centered in the button, make it a real functional button, make it look like a button, fix that. I ask you to increase or decrease the spacing in the quote five stage integration methodology of design C. This is both white mode and dark mode, light mode and dark mode. So just tighten up the vertical spacing of the five stage integration methodology. The rollers of the value creation framework work great. Good job there. You did nothing in the section that has the line charts or bar charts in the module called partnership model comparison. In the three sub buttons below that, every chart is still 100% regardless of the percentage. So fix that, find a new approach to animate that chart and make it a real chart based on the percentages. You have the values, nothing changed there in previous edits. Okay, that's everything for design C.

And finally, the design hyphen D in dark mode. Spacing is good. The colors are good. I like everything about the dark mode of design D except the hero section buttons are broken like all the other buttons. So this is a common problem that happened with buttons. There, here there's a black button and a white button. The text is not centered. The roll over doesn't work in the white button. Just understand the dark mode buttons in the hero section of design D need to be rebuilt. The second section that has the title every revolution starts with a problem is black on black. So that text is not readable. That's probably a header one or header two. Also right below that section is called the journey from risk to revenue quote end quote. It's also black text on black background. Other headers are white on different color backgrounds. I saw the number of animations that was good. And then there's a section near the bottom called quote your story starts here as black text on black background. Find a way to prevent that from happening. They obviously that never works. You know that's not an option in dark mode blacks text on black background. Make that a rule to never allow that. And in the white mode of design D the sub header is disappeared because it is white text on a white background. So correct that. And then we've got to fix the buttons in the hero section. All the other parts of the white mode are acceptable except the one that you didn't address in the previous list is in the section called quote your story starts here. Close quote and this a module of a card or a little rectangular box called quote the future we build close quote those five bullet points are five green bullet points. The text is too light make both of those cards in that section quote your story starts here close quote section identical make it black or dark gray. Bring the text give it bullet points the equally balanced for the left and right boxes that looks uniform. Below that there's a button that says quote begin your transformation basically just takes you to the next stage we can delete that button altogether just delete that button. The stories of transformation have the numerical values 114,000 30,000 71 billion 47 make those colored make those animated make those interesting give it some you know Chad CN or react styling and that's it for white mode of design D.
