It will be a tool for brand building, lead generation, and client education, designed to convert interest into direct engagement.

Product Requirements Document (PRD): Thrivemore Technology Advisors Website

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing a modern, engaging website for Thrivemore Technology Advisors, a firm specializing in technology master planning for large-scale real estate developments. The website will serve as a digital showcase of the company's expertise, services, case studies, and leadership, drawing from the provided strategic blueprint content. The site must embody a tech-oriented aesthetic—sleek, innovative, and forward-thinking—while aligning with Thrivemore's brand as a trusted advisor in creating "enduring, connected places." The design will emphasize connectivity, sustainability, and future-readiness, using dynamic elements to engage users.

The website will be built using modern web technologies (e.g., via Cloud Code environments like Google Cloud Code, AWS Cloud9, or similar IDEs for collaborative coding). It should be a single-page application (SPA) where possible for fluid navigation, or a multi-page site with seamless transitions, implemented in frameworks like React.js or Next.js for dynamic content, with Tailwind CSS or similar for styling.

### 1.2 Goals
- Educate visitors on the importance of technology in real estate development and Thrivemore's role in de-risking projects.
- Showcase services, case studies, and leadership to build credibility and generate leads.
- Provide an intuitive, interactive user experience that feels cutting-edge, with animations and dynamic content to highlight tech themes.
- Optimize for SEO, responsiveness, and performance to reach developers, investors, and industry professionals.
- Drive conversions through contact forms and calls-to-action (CTAs) for consultations.

### 1.3 Scope
- In-Scope: Full website build including frontend (UI/UX), basic backend for forms (e.g., email integration via Node.js or serverless like AWS Lambda), content integration from the blueprint, animations, and dynamic elements.
- Out-of-Scope: E-commerce, user accounts, advanced analytics integration (beyond Google Analytics), mobile app development. Graphical elements (logos, icons) will be provided by the user; placeholders should be used until then.
- Assumptions: Hosting on cloud platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or AWS). No custom CMS unless specified; use static site generation for speed.

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds.

- Conversion rate > 5% on contact forms.
- SEO score > 80/100 via tools like Lighthouse.

## 2. Target Audience

## 3. Brand Guidelines

Inferring from limited site data (nature-themed images like farms and coastlines), blend natural, grounded elements with tech motifs.

- **Color Scheme** (Tech-oriented with grounded tones):
  - Primary: Deep Blue (#003366) for trust and connectivity.
  - Secondary: Teal (#00A896) for innovation and wellness.

  - Neutral: White (#FFFFFF), Light Gray (#F5F5F5), Dark Gray (#333333).
  - Backgrounds: Subtle gradients from blue to teal for tech feel; overlay with wireframe or circuit patterns for sections on connectivity.
