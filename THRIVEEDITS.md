Review all these edits across each of the four pages. 

In addition to the specific instructions for edits in each of the four pages, make sure everything has a professional, modern, award-winning web look and feel, build sequences as the page loads, but do not let that impact processing load times. When you're finished with all the edits, go back through the entire four pages of the website and optimize for iOS and Android. And at the end of all the edits, check for linting errors and errors before we open local host.

I'm going to define them in groupings by the page itself. The web page will begin with design-a. 

Edits for https://thrivetest.web0101.com/design-a

In the hero section, add more space above the hero one title. Make the button on the left that has the gray box and the black type. A color. Maybe a greenish color as well as the view case studies. I can't read what the one on the left is. It says schedule a consultant. Make both those buttons like a green from the logo. And where it says trusted by premier developers. Highlight those company names and use a react component to scroll them across the page. Make them larger. Scroll them horizontally. All those are comments in dark mode when I switch to light mode for design-a. The same two buttons in the hero section at the top of the page need to be colorized. The icons in the second section quote a fundamental shift in development risk. You can't afford to ignore those icons. Don't show up with a red circle background like they do in the dark mode. The background is washed away. We went to great lengths to make the white mode purely white but now it's too stark. We should have some kind of section background for architecting the digital DNA of your community that can be just a light gradient background. Maybe the same thing with a light gradient background in the case studies and visionary development. And then at the end the section that says decades of experience at the intersection of real estate and technology. All those icons are of course placeholders of photos but they are they're black. So just put in a white a white border outline with a head not a solid black icon even though it's a placeholder. And then the very bottom start your technology master plan has a button to contact. The button says schedule consultation consultation make that consistent with the other buttons at the bottom.

These are the edits for Thrivemore Design - B in dark mode. Let's reduce the height of the hero section. There's too much space above and below the hero content, which is the "new development imperative" close quote and then the four buttons with financial data to make that extra padding or height maybe 50% less. The second section right hand column underneath the quote "the 71 billion question" make those three colors less saturated. The colors for the text quote "no guarantee mass up liability solution ready" make those slightly less saturated colors. Everything else is good. The advisory practice, you have to click on each of the one through five in the advisory practice section. I want you to change that with a component. This could be CSS, Tailwinds, React, whatever is best for this schema where the mouse rollover changes them. Right now there's only corresponding detail in the number one section, the number one item which is "discovery and analyzes" close quote. That's the only one that has a panel to the right side. The other ones are empty. Can you go back to the original product requirement doc and see if there was copy for the other four sections of our advisory practice? The other four sections would be quote "master planning, negotiation and selection, implementation, operations and evolution" close quote. So if there's content for those added to the right panel that is not going to operate as a rollover. Generally throughout all areas of every website, this is a universal thing. I'll try to mention again in have animation as it builds and rollover as it happens. This is working in some areas, not consistently everywhere. And then at the very bottom of design -B, the button needs to be higher contrast. Right now it's a green button on a green background. This is connect and explore. So make that appropriate color button. That's everything for design B in dark mode, design B in white mode. Same thing about the spacing above and below the hero section in white mode. The animated lines need to be more pronounced, more visible. The line thickness can be greater. We don't want the lines to cover over the objects. They are appearing on top of the buttons in the text. Again, reduce the super saturated colors in the white mode. Apply all the text and rollover and content changes in dark mode to the white mode. This is about the advisory practice section we just talked about. And the button at the bottom needs to be higher contrast where it says connect and explore. That's everything for design B.

Now we begin with design C in dark mode. Dark mode is really screwed up because it needs a lot of work. I can send you a screen image, but the dark mode has white backgrounds with black objects and light color gray text on top of white backgrounds. This is in the dark mode setting. The content is really cool, the layout is really cool, but the dark mode is literally black and white. The aspect readability contrast is completely useless. Now, I'm not going to talk about that, but in the white mode of design C, it looks great. It looks much better. We can tighten up the five stage integration methodology. There's a lot of spacing in between each of those five stages. Make that tighter, less vertical height. Same thing with a section called value creation framework. Make that an object where the mouse rollover activates those four buttons on the left, the four buttons on the left are de-risk investment, comma transform cost of revenue, comma accelerate sales, comma future proof assets. Each of those can be rollover to change the panel on the right side of that section. The partnership model comparison. I really like that idea as an interactive chart, but all the chart elements are the same length, which is meaningless. This is the chart that has the title partnership model comparison NEMA, EMA, bulk service and joint venture. There's probably a scale up to $1,200, but the lines, the indicator of the charts are all at 100%. Same thing with revenue impact and risk reduction in IRR growth. So make the chart functioning to the percentage and give it some animation when you rollover or when it builds. So they build together and they animate as you click on the three variables, which are IRR growth, revenue impact and risk reduction. The case studies and excellence in the white mode, again, we're in white mode of design C. Case studies and excellence is really boring. It's just white on white. So give those two cards some gradient color and rollover effect. And then the bottom is pretty generic, but okay. So that's design C.

Now we're looking at the design D in dark mode. I like this the best great job in dark mode. Again, the hero section has way too much space above and below the H1 title called quote the future well grounded close quote. So remove the spacing above and below that at least 50% above and below. All of this looks very sexy. This is this is the style we want to try to maintain for all dark modes, not the exact design, but the feeling and the professional and the modern look. All the dark mode should be similar to design D in terms of the contrast. Again, add roll over effects and build effects as the page happens. And then the bottom of there's a section called quote stories of transformation at the bottom. There are four values under a section subsection called collective impact. Make those interestingly animate as you as you roll over them or excuse me as the section builds like let those be live counters. And these are the numbers that go to 114,000 130,071 billion and 47 plus. So build those from zero to the value, but but fast, you know, the whole build the whole numerical build, like a count count up, you should happen in one or two seconds. You can do it by hundreds or thousands, whatever. The buttons that are gradient orange are a little too saturated. We can turn those down a little bit. Other than that, everything in the dark mode looks very good. Congratulations. In the white mode for design D. We just need some element in the hero section in the dark mode had the animated sky objects, the animated particles. So do some similar version in the white mode or light mode. It's just boring white text on a white background and adjust the spacing as well. In white mode of design D, the orange buttons appear too saturated and kind of stand out. We need to have a color, a new color scheme in white mode for design D. I think we're missing. No, that's fine. In white mode design D. We also need to make the stories of transformation more interesting with some gradient colors to the cards. Same thing with collective impact use the same number animation we talked about the section called our your section called quote your story starts here close quote has a card on the right there. This is quote the future we build those green for green bullet points that the text has to be black. There is gray and you can't read it. So make that all black. And I make those if you can. And then this whole saturated gradient orange. Change those buttons consistently everywhere to a slightly lighter color or I say what on this one. Take all the orange gradient buttons and make it blue green gradient consistent with the thrive more logo. And that's everything for design D.
